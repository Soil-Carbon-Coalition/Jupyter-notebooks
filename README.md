# Jupyter-notebooks
A few Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and mapping around landscape function, watershed function, and externalized costs, using pandas, folium (python wrapper for Leaflet), and various libraries for getting water and rainfall data from US Geological Survey and other APIs. This is focused on local feedback loops (such as county, HUC8 watershed) on watershed function and soil health.
